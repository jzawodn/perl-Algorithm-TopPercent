Algorithm-TopPercent version 0.02
=================================

A Perl extension for tracking the most popular items seen in a large
stream of data using fixed memory.

This module implements a simple algorithm first described to my by Udi
Manber when he was the Chief Scientist at Yahoo! Inc.  It implements
a set of data structures and a counting technique that allow you to
track the top-N (or top-N percent) in a stream of data using fixed
memory, provided that certain conditions are met.  See the DETAILS
section for more information.

I have reimplemented it mostly from my memory of his description
roughly 8 years ago.
